Using OMF with Cloud Services
=============================

This document describes how the OSIsoft Message Format (OMF) is interpreted by OSIsoft Cloud Services 
(OCS) back-end system. 

Headers
-------

A description of each of the headers can be found in the OMF documentation 
located `here <http://omf-docs.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9/>`_. When 
sending messages to OSIsoft Cloud Services, the value of the ``producertoken`` header must be 
set to a security token obtained from the OCS Portal. This security token is used to authenticate 
the sender and authorize for use with a particular Tenant and Device.

Message Types
-------------

OMF message types fall into three categories: Type, Container, and Data. 

* **Type messages**

  A Type message is interpreted by OSIsoft Cloud Services as a QiType in the OSC Data Store. 
  Because QiTypes are immutable, update operations are not supported. The keywords in the 
  Type definition are interpreted as follows:
  
  + ``id``: Corresponds to the QiType Id field. It must conform to the rules defined for a 
    typeId specified `here <http://qi-docs-rst.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Qi_Types.html>`_
    
  + ``classification``: Only the ``dynamic`` classification is currently supported.
  + ``version``: Versioning of QiTypes is not supported.
  + ``name``: Corresponds to the QiType Name field. This is the friendly name for the type.
  + ``description``: Corresponds to the QIType Description field. 
  + ``tags``: Currently unsupported.
  + ``metadata``: Currently unsupported.
  
  The ``isindex`` keyword corresponds to the ``iskey`` attribute of a QiTypeProperty. 
  QiTypes support clustered indexes which can be specified with multiple properties marked 
  with the ``isindex`` keyword with a value of ``true``. The ``indexorder`` keyword 
  corresponds to the ``Order`` field of a QiTypeProperty and can be used to specify 
  the order within a clustered index. The ``isname`` keyword is not supported.

* **Link Type**

  Link Types are not supported in OCS Data Store.

* **Span Type**

  Span Types are not supported in OCS Data Store.
  
* **Property Types and Formats**

  OMF supports setting the ``format`` keyword to specify how a particular JSON type should 
  be interpreted. The following is a mapping for the OSC Data Store supported 
  types (see `QiType information <http://qi-docs-rst.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Qi_Types.html>`_)
  
::

            array,,array,IEnumerable
            boolean,,boolean
            integer,int64,Int64
            integer,int16,Int16
            integer,uint64,Uint64
            integer,uint32,Uint32
            integer,uint16,Uint16
            number,float64,double
            number,float32,double
            number,float16,double
            object,dictionary,IDictionary
            string,,String
            string,date-time,DateTime  
  
  
Container messages
------------------

A Container message is interpreted as a QiStream in the OCS Data Store. The keywords 
in the Container definition are interpreted as follows:

* ``id``: Corresponds to the QiStream Id field. It must conform to the rules defined for 
  a QiStream.Id specified here: `here <http://qi-docs-rst.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Qi_Streams.html>`_)
* ``typeid``: Corresponds to the QiStream TypeId field.
* ``typeversion``: Versioning of QiTypes is not supported.
* ``name``: Corresponds to the QiStream Name field. This is a friendly name for the stream.
* ``description``: Corresponds to the QiStream Description field.
* ``tags``: Corresponds to the QiStream Tag field. 
* ``metadata``: Corresponds to the QiStream Metadata field        


Data messages
-------------

A Data message is mapped to generic Qi values in the OSC Data Store. The keywords in the 
Data definitions are interpreted as follows:

* ``typeid``: Data that is not grouped by containerId is not supported.
* ``containerid``: Stream Id for the associated Qi Stream.
* ``typeversion``: Not supported.
* ``values``: An array of the generic Qi values.
